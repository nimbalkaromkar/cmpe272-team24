In today’s fast-paced world, a person can get sick
easily. Most of the time this sickness is due to very
common diseases like Fever, Headache, Allergy,
etc. In such case we tend to use common medicines
to these diseases. Every person’s body reacts
differently to these medicines due to which these
medicines on most of the occasions cause side
effects. An option for using these medicines to the
common diseases can be to use alternative
medicines which do not cause any potential
harmful side effects. Such medicines and therapies
can be found in Ayurveda, Chinese Traditional
Medicine, Chiropractic, Naturopathy, and
Homeopathy.
The solution proposed will provide user all the
available alternative medicines to the common
disease.
